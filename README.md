The Code

This repository contains the code for the 2012-2013 compeititon for the Ada Graces team. The TeleOp.c file contains the code for controlling the motors during the human operated portion of the game. Autonomous.c contains the code that will place the ring on a peg in the column that contains the IR sensor.

The Team
-----------
he Ada Graces are lead by returning members Abril Vela (11th grade) and Safia Abdalla (11th grade). After competing as FTC rookies last year, Abril and Safia noticed that not many girls competed in FTC. So, they decided to organize an all girls FTC team, with the help of our robotics mentor Jeff Solin. 

We named ourselves after Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper, both prominent females in computer science in order to show our passion about being women in tech. At the Illinois Qualifiers at Whitney Young, we were the only all girls team and showed our team spirit by wearing pink bows and our team T-shirts featuring a lego robot skull also adorned with a pink bow. 

Our FTC robot uses an elevator lift to raise up to the height of a peg and a new double sided claw to grab rings. To control the elevator, we created our own pulley system that we threaded with wire that collects on the motor to raise the arm.
